# HTML5-JS-Game-CoronaWarrior

The purpose was to build the game both mobile platform Android and AppStore, but the good thing is games related to coronavirus on markets are PROHIBITED. I realized after developing game while building for android, and ios:)

Play the game --> http://umitunal.org/coronawarrior/game/

        Use Arrow key to control character
        Use Space to fire in order to kill the viruses
        Randomly mask or disinfectant comes up. Mask heals +30 , disinfectant heals +20. 
        If corona virus touches you, decreases your heal -30
        If corona virus pass through layout, decreases your heal -10
